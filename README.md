##### **FEATURES** 🪶
<p>
 HTTPS Validator:
 Check the validity of HTTPS support on websites. Quickly identify whether a site supports secure connections. It doesn't perform in-depth security assessments. For a comprehensive penetration test, you would typically use more advanced tools that check for security vulnerabilities. The script follows redirects, which is a good enhancement. However, be aware that it checks only the final URL for HTTPS support. For a more thorough test, you might want to analyze all intermediate steps in the redirect chain.<br>

The timeout value is set to 10 seconds, but depending on the target websites and network conditions, you may need to adjust it accordingly.<br>

Logging and Reporting:
For penetration testing, it's crucial to log results and report findings in a detailed manner. This script currently prints messages to the console, but in a real-world scenario, you might want to log results to a file and provide a comprehensive report.<br>

Error Handling:
The script provides basic error handling for connection errors. Depending on the context, you might want to log more detailed information about errors for analysis.
